        Validate the attributes of a Car instance before saving it to the database.

        Validation Rules:
        1. Car Existence Check:
            - Checks if a car with the same make, model, year, color, mileage, and car_type already exists in the database.
            - Uses iexact operator to make a case-insensitive comparison of the make, model, and color.
            - If a duplicate car is found (excluding the current instance by its ID), it raises a ValidationError.

        2. Sold Car Validation:
            - If the 'sold' attribute is True, it checks for the presence of 'date_sold' and 'salesperson'.
            - If 'date_sold' or 'salesperson' is missing when a car is marked as sold, it raises a ValidationError.

        3. Salesperson Assignment Validation:
            - If a 'salesperson' is assigned to the car, it checks for the presence of 'date_sold' and 'sold' status.
            - If 'date_sold' or 'sold' status is missing when a salesperson is assigned, it raises a ValidationError.

        4. Sale Date Validation:
            - If a 'date_sold' is specified, it checks for the presence of 'salesperson' and 'sold' status.
            - If 'salesperson' or 'sold' status is missing when a sale date is set, it raises a ValidationError.
            - It also checks if the 'date_sold' is not in the future. If it is, it raises a ValidationError.
